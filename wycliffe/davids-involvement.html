<h2>David’s involvement</h2>
<h4>What does David do?</h4>
<p>David is based at home, developing software tools to support computing in complex scripts and minority languages.  This technical work makes a real difference in the process of translating the Bible into the languages that use these scripts.</p>
<p>Elizabeth helps David in his work for Wycliffe, particularly with developing and maintaining links with supporters.</p>
<h4>David’s path to working for Wycliffe</h4>
<p><span class="italic">"We have had an interest in Bible translation going back to when we both worked for Bible Society in the 1980s.  However, after leaving Bible Society in 1989, I had a variety of roles in secular IT.  In 2009 I felt led to consider working for Wycliffe Bible Translators and began exploring that idea.  Elizabeth and I visited their headquarters near High Wycombe, and were excited by what we learned about their work.  I applied to join Wycliffe, became a member in April 2010 and started raising support.  We had a strong sense that this new ministry was where God was leading us - with the support of our church, St Andrew’s, Clevedon - and I began work in December 2010.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">I don’t receive a salary from Wycliffe, but rely for our financial needs on those whom God prompts to support us in this way.  We have enjoyed the opportunity to speak about Wycliffe to many churches and groups and are continually encouraged by people’s prayers and support.”</span></p>
