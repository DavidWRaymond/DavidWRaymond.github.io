<h2>A message from the Director of Wycliffe</h2>
<p><img src="director.jpg" align="right" alt="James Poole" width="20%" />More than 1,329 New Testament translations completed! More than 2,195 language projects in progress! People like you make this possible!  Translation, Scripture use and literacy programmes bring God's word to people all over the world.</p>
<p>A pastor in the Democratic Republic of Congo said, “I can understand French with my ear, and Swahili with my mind, but my own language I understand with my heart.”</p>
<p>Your partnership with what God is doing through Wycliffe will have a global impact.  How can you help?  Prayer support is foundational.  Financial support is critical.  Encouragement is essential.  Every partner plays a vital role in the work, and you are invited to join the team.  Please join with us as we serve God in reaching out to his world with his word.</p>
<p>We want to see God’s message of love translated into these languages and bearing fruit in the lives of the people who speak them.  It's a commission for the whole Church. Bible translation requires all kinds of people. Some people need to go. Others need to send them. Will you help?</p>
